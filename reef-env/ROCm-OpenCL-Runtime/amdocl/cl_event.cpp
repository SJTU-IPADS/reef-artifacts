 *  Event objects can be used to refer to a kernel execution command:
 *    - clEnqueueNDRangeKernel
 *    - clEnqueueTask
 *    - clEnqueueNativeKernel
 *
 *  or read, write, map and copy commands on memory objects:
 *    - clEnqueue{Read|Write|Map}{Buffer|Image}
 *    - clEnqueueCopy{Buffer|Image}
 *    - clEnqueueCopyBufferToImage
 *    - clEnqueueCopyImageToBuffer
 *
 *  An event object can be used to track the execution status of a command.
 *  The execution status of a command at any given point in time can be
 *  CL_QUEUED (is currently in the command queue),
 *  CL_RUNNING (device is currently executing this command),
 *  CL_COMPLETE (command has successfully completed) or the appropriate error
 *  code if the command was abnormally terminated (this may be caused by a bad
 *  memory access etc.). The error code returned by a terminated command is
 *  a negative integer value. A command is considered to be complete if its
 *  execution status is CL_COMPLETE or is a negative integer value.
 *
 *  If the execution of a command is terminated, the command-queue associated
 *  with this terminated command, and the associated context (and all other
 *  command-queues in this context) may no longer be available. The behavior of
 *  OpenCL API calls that use this context (and command-queues associated with
 *  this context) are now considered to be implementationdefined. The user
 *  registered callback function specified when context is created can be used
 *  to report appropriate error information.

 *    There is no guarantee that the callback functions registered for various
 *    execution status values for an event will be called in the exact order
 *    that the execution status of a command changes.

 *        event_command_exec_status represents the execution status of command
 *        for which this callback function is invoked. If the callback is called
 *        as the result of the command associated with event being abnormally
 *        terminated, an appropriate error code for the error that caused the

 * \a user_data is a pointer to user supplied data. user_data will be passed as
 *    the user_data argument when pfn_notify is called. user_data can be NULL.
 *
 * All callbacks registered for an event object must be called. All enqueued
 * callbacks shall be called before the event object is destroyed. Callbacks
 * must return promptly. The behavior of calling expensive system routines,
 * OpenCL API calls to create contexts or command-queues, or blocking OpenCL
 * operations from the following list below, in a callback is undefined.
 *     clFinish, clWaitForEvents, blocking calls to clEnqueueReadBuffer,
 *     clEnqueueReadBufferRect, clEnqueueWriteBuffer, clEnqueueWriteBufferRect,

 *
 * If an application needs to wait for completion of a routine from the above
 * list in a callback, please use the non-blocking form of the function, and
 * assign a completion callback to it to do the remainder of your work.
 * Note that when a callback (or other code) enqueues commands to a
 * command-queue, the commands are not required to begin execution until the
 * queue is flushed. In standard usage, blocking enqueue calls serve this role
 * by implicitly flushing the queue. Since blocking calls are not permitted in
 * callbacks, those callbacks that enqueue commands on a command queue should
 * either call clFlush on the queue before returning or arrange for clFlush
 * to be called later on another thread.
